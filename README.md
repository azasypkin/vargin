# Vargin
__Vargin__ is easy to use Web IDE that allows you to create mobile/desktop web applications
based on widely known component architecture. You don't have to be developer to
get started as creating new app is as simple as just adding functional pieces via
drag&drop from available list of visual (button, form, header, ...) and service
(device camera or mic, Bluetooth LE, any web service integration and etc.) components.

Using full power of modern web browser you can customize and style your components
as much as you wish!

You work can be exported to ready-to-go optimized web application or platform
independent JSON format that can potentially be used by native application generator.
If appropriate application generator is available you can pack your lovely IoT
board with any application or service you need.

In case you want to go with web application (that is highly recommended _default_ option!)
application will be based on modern web stack that will provide you with
multithreading, plugin-less media and first-class offline experience.

Vargin is successor and inspired by my old fancy project [__Mikapp__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwzPWSHY7jA) and [__Style My Image!__](http://azasypkin.github.io/style-my-image/) tool.

__Current status:__ [in active development] (https://vargin.github.io/vargin/dist/dev/).
